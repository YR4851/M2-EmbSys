# 1 ABOUT THE PROJECT
   ## Description:
   This is an automation project which is used to control the speed of fan automatically with the help of an temperature sensor which is used to sense the temperature here and sends the data forward by which means the fan speed is controlled to maintain a specific temperature at a pre-defined value of it.

   ## Features:
   * LCD Display shall be provided to know the temperature value we set.
   * Room Temperature shall be displayed on LCD.
   * Fan is on or off shall be displayed on LCD.
   * Fan speed shall be displayed on LCD.
   * LED's shall be provided for the funtioning display of embedded system.
   ## Working state of art:
   The main focus of this project is to control the tempereature and humidity of a perticular room in which it is being implimented with the help of sensors and the microcontroller. Here an LCD display is being used to display some information for user interfacing purpose. As if we see the growth of the technology around us, these types of technologies are the becoming the future of these industries.
