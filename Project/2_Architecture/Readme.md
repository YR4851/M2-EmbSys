  ## Sensor: 
  
   ### Temperature Sensor (Thermistor):
   
   * This Thermistor is a resistor whose resistance is dependent on temperature here this change in resistence produces change in voltage, this voltage is taken as input to micro controller.
   
   ### Soil moisture sensor:
   
   * Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighing of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content.
   
  ## Actuators:
  
   ### Relay:
   
   * A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. 
  
   ### LCD Display:
   
   * Displays each and every value we enter in our keypad along with Temperature.
   
   ### LED's:
   
   * LED displays the on and off status of the device.
   
  ## MICRO CONTROLLER AND MEMORY
  
   ### EEPROM
   
   * Here this is actually inside the microcontroller
   
   ### Clock
   
   * Here we are using internal clock of our micro controller.
   
   ### MicroController:
   
   * This is the main component which controls all the above mentioned part or thins of our embedded system.This interfaces keypad and LCD and controlls the fan,light and doors depending on the value we pressed on keypad.
   
  ## SUBSYSTEM & OTHERS
  
   ### Relay Module:
   
   * A 5v relay is an automatic switch that is commonly used in an automatic control circuit and to control a high-current using a low-current signal. The input voltage of the relay signal ranges from 0 to 5V.
