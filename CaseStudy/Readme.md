## Case Study 1: ELECTRIC TOASTER

![TOASTER FLOWCHART](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YR4851/M2-EmbSys/main/CaseStudy/FLOWCHART_TOASTER.png)



## START PUCH DOWN ROD:
this is the starting of toaster which push down the bread and start the process of browning by allowing the power contactors to close and starts conducting electriciy through whole circuitary.

## BREAD RACK:
this is the place where the breads are kept for browning.

## LCD DISPLAY:
this outputs the time remaining and other necessary functions to be displayed.

## TIMER REGULATOR:
this is used by user for giving the toaster specific time for the job of browing the breads.

## BROWNING CONTROL:
this feature is used to allow the user to set how much crunchy or burnt they like their toast to be.

## HEAT CONTROL:
this allows user to control further heating features in the toaster.

## HEAT SENSOR:
this sensor is used inside the toaster for maintaining the required temperature for accuracy.

## TIMER:
this helps the toaster to know upto how much time does it have to start and stop.

## ELECTROMAGNETIC COILS:
this helps to hold the start rod down for browining process.

## 220V CONTACTORS:
these are two contactors which only allows electricty to flow through the circuitary only when the start rod is made push down by the user.

## NICHROME WIRE ON MICA:
this is the main heating part of the toaster as the nichrome wire is placed oon the mica plates for heating the breads also mica here helps to save other parts of the toaster against burning or heating at higher temperatures.
